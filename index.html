          <p class="lead">Justin was in eighth grade when he was diagnosed with visual processing disorder; a learning disability which inhibited his brainâ€™s ability to perceive visual information. In an effort to correct the problem Justin underwent many months of intense physical therapy to help retrain his eyes. However, there are just some things that no amount of therapy can fix, and as a result he entered the ninth grade with the reading level of a fourth grader. Unable to keep pace with his peers he fell further and further behind, with failing grades becoming a common occurrence Justin let his learning disability paralyze him. He stopped trying, and just simply gave up. He became dependent on those around him to do the work for him, and watched as people continually lower their expectations of him. Demotivated and depressed Justin turned to the internet to find someone who could understand his situation. Justin was 15 years old when he was victimized by an online predator. </p>

          <p class="lead">It was on this journey that Justin developed the skills which have allowed him to achieve much of the success in his life. Justin began to embrace his differences, and it was then that he realized that while his learning disability inhibited my literary ability, it also allowed him to see patterns and connections that were otherwise not visible to the rest of the world. From that day forward Justin leveraged his ability to think differently in order to gain a competitive edge in life.</p>
